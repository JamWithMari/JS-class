// Consider that a hamburger has many options â€“ that might include

    vegetable garnishes, 
    assortments of cheeses, 
    specialty sauces, 
    different meat patties(beef, chicken, vegetarian),

    Pickles, hot peppers, olives etc.

// add some extra if you want
// Make sure that the function allows for the output of a sentence that describes the hamburger, too
